## Description

These goggles are a remix of the above thingiverse link, but instead of the spring and 
fishing line they are controlled by independent servos.
The maker kit comes with an ES08AII, a second one will be required. I used an additional
RGB led also.
The AA battery pack powers the servos power shield/lipo battery power everything else.
Wiring diagram and additional print files pending.
